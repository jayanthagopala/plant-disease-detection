Project Title: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
Theme: Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development
Problem Statement ID: 25010

⸻

1. Objective

To build a Smart Crop Advisory solution (mobile app/chatbot) that empowers small and marginal farmers in India with personalized, real-time, and localized crop advisories. The system will use AI, weather data, and image recognition to provide actionable insights in farmers’ native languages, helping them increase yield, reduce costs, and adopt sustainable farming practices.

⸻

2. Problem Context
	•	Farmers rely on guesswork or local shopkeepers for crop decisions.
	•	Challenges:
	•	Poor yield due to lack of scientific advisories.
	•	Excessive input costs and misuse of fertilizers/pesticides.
	•	Language barriers and low digital literacy.
	•	Absence of localized advisory tools.
	•	Impact: Informed decisions can improve productivity, reduce losses, and promote sustainability.

⸻

3. Target Users
	•	Primary Users:
	•	Small and marginal farmers (86% of Indian farmers, NABARD 2022).
	•	Secondary Users / Stakeholders:
	•	Agricultural extension officers.
	•	Government agriculture departments.
	•	NGOs and cooperatives.
	•	Agri-tech startups.

	2.	Soil & Fertilizer Guidance
	•	Input: soil health card or farmer input.
	•	Output: recommendations on fertilizer usage.
	3.	Weather-based Insights
	•	Real-time weather alerts (rainfall, drought, frost warnings).
	•	Predictive models for crop planning.
	4.	Pest & Disease Detection
	•	Farmers upload leaf/crop photos.
	•	AI/ML model detects pest/disease and suggests treatment.
	5.	Market Price Tracking
	•	Real-time market prices for common crops.
	•	Alerts on favorable selling opportunities.
	6.	Feedback & Usage Tracking
	•	Collect farmer feedback for advisory improvement.
	•	Data analytics for adoption monitoring.

⸻

5. Expected Outcomes
	•	Increased crop yield (20–30%, as per ICT advisory studies).
	•	Reduced fertilizer and pesticide misuse.
	•	Improved farmer income and sustainability.
	•	Democratization of modern agri-tech for marginalized groups.

⸻

6. Technical Requirements

Frontend
	•	Android-first mobile app (progressive web app as backup).
	•	Simple UI with icons, voice commands, and chatbot.

Backend
	•	AI/ML services for pest/disease detection.
	•	Weather API integration.
	•	Market price API integration.
	•	Multilingual NLP models for chatbot responses.

Data Storage
	•	Crop history and usage data stored securely.

⸻

7. Constraints & Challenges
	•	Low internet penetration in rural areas → offline mode support.
	•	Device limitations (low-end smartphones).
	•	Ensuring accuracy of AI models with limited datasets.
	•	Building trust among farmers for adoption.

⸻

8. Success Metrics
	•	Number of farmers onboarded.
	•	Percentage improvement in yield/productivity.
	•	Reduction in fertilizer/pesticide misuse.
	•	Farmer satisfaction (measured via feedback).

⸻

9. Future Enhancements
	•	Integration with government subsidy/loan schemes.
	•	IoT-based soil/moisture sensors.
	•	Crop insurance advisory.
	•	Blockchain-based traceability for produce.

⸻

10. References
	•	NABARD Report (2022): 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal.
	•	Studies showing ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.
