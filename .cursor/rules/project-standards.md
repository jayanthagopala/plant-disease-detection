# Smart Crop Advisory System - College Project Development Standards

## Project Overview
Building a multilingual AI-based crop advisory system for small and marginal farmers in India as a college project. Focus on pest & disease detection with comprehensive academic documentation.

## Project Context
- **Theme**: Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development
- **Problem Statement ID**: 25010
- **Academic Focus**: Demonstrating AI/ML applications for social impact
- **Target Users**: Small and marginal farmers (86% of Indian farmers)

## Technology Stack (College Project Scope)
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python-based web framework for demo)
- **Backend**: Direct Streamlit integration (simplified for academic project)
- **AI/ML**: PyTorch with torchvision for image recognition
- **Data**: PlantVillage dataset for disease detection
- **Future Scope**: Android app, weather APIs, market price APIs

## Core Principles (Academic Focus)
- **Educational Value** - Clear code structure for academic review
- **Social Impact** - Focus on helping Indian farmers
- **Documentation** - Comprehensive documentation for academic presentation
- **Reproducibility** - Clear setup instructions and requirements
- **Interpretability** - Model explanations and visualizations
- **Accessibility** - Simple UI for low-literate users

## Code Standards (College Project)
- Use Python type hints for type safety and clarity
- Implement proper error handling with informative messages
- Add loading states for all async operations using st.spinner()
- Use Streamlit session state for data management
- Implement proper form validation with st.form()
- Add comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
- Use Streamlit's built-in accessibility features
- Include detailed docstrings for academic review
- Comment complex algorithms and ML model decisions
- Use meaningful variable names for code readability

## Academic Documentation Requirements
- Document all design decisions and trade-offs
- Include performance metrics and evaluation results
- Provide clear methodology explanations
- Include visualizations and model interpretability
- Document social impact and farmer benefits
- Prepare for academic presentation and review
